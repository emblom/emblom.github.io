                            All instruments want to play parts from other instruments, but it can be hard to translate the piece to their range and clef. Musicians also want to know what the piece sounds like a group, for their instrument, or for other instruments/sections.

                            I made up a story for my persona that I created above. I thought of what why she would want to use the app and what features she would like. Then included them in my story! My team did the same for their personnas as well.

                            I made sketches of what the app could look like. This are rough thoughts and ideas of how the different screens of the app may look. My team members did the same.
